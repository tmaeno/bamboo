Subject: Task Exhaustion Issue - Database Timeout

Hi team,

We've been experiencing issues with tasks going into exhausted state.
After investigation, we found that the root cause is database connection timeouts
occurring when the system is under heavy load.

The error message we're seeing is:
"DatabaseConnectionError: Connection timeout after 30 seconds"

This typically happens during peak hours when we have more than 1000 concurrent users.

Resolution:
1. Increased the connection pool size from 10 to 50
2. Added retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Implemented connection pooling optimization

After these changes, the issue was resolved.

Best regards,
John Doe
