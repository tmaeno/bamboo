"""Code Map node models.

The Code Map is a machine-derived view of a target system's source: where the
code *determines* the value of a subject, under what conditions, and where it
hands off to another system.  It is stored in the same Neo4j database as the
incident graph but under its own labels, because the two have opposite
lifecycles -- the Code Map is regenerated from source at will, the incident
graph is human-validated and irreplaceable.

Three node kinds:

``SubjectNode``
    An attribute whose value is worth asking "why is it this?" about --
    promoted from the declared spec attributes by the census criteria.
``JunctionNode``
    A place where the code settles a subject's value.  Its branches are the
    possible outcomes, each with the path condition that selects it.  A
    junction does not *judge*; the branch taken follows deterministically from
    the conditions, which is why it is not called a decision point (that term
    is reserved for the constrained points where an LLM or a human chooses).
``BoundaryNode``
    Where causation crosses into a system this map does not cover.  Modelled
    explicitly rather than left as an absence so that adding the other
    system's map later is a *binding* operation instead of a re-derivation.

Identity is a semantic signature, never a file position.  Positions move --
between ``panda-server-source`` 0.8.1 and 1.0.2 the pilot boundary moved file
entirely (``jobdispatcher/JobDispatcher.py`` disappeared; the entry is now
``api/v1/pilot_api.py::update_job``) while remaining the same boundary.  The
anchor records where the evidence was found; the signature says what it *is*.
